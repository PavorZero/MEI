# Scripts
This repository contains four Python scripts: equal name comparison (comparemei.py), distinct name comparison (distinctmei.py), text normalization (normalize.py) and the last one to remove unnecessary line breaks, tabs and spaces (limpol.py). The results are exported to an Excel file for easy analysis.
